    OBJECT EXERCISE 
    <br>

    For each of the exercises below, assume you are starting with the following programming bjects.

    <br>

    let programming = { <br>
        language: ['JavaScript', 'Python', 'Ruby'], <br>
        isChallenging: true, <br>
        isRewarding: true, <br>
        difficulty: 8, <br>
        jokes: 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/234075/what-is-your-best-programmer-joke' <br>
    }; <br>


    1. Write  the command to add the language 'Go' to the end of the languages array. <br>
    2. Change the difficulty to the value of 7. <br>
    3. Using the <i>delete</i> keyword, write the command to remove the jokes key from the programming object. <br>
    4. Write the command to add a new key called <i>isFun</i> and a value of <i>true</i> to the programming object. <br>
    5. Using a loop, iterate through the languages array and console.log all of he languages. <br>
    6. Using a loop, console.log all of the languages in the programming object. <br>
    7. Using a loop, console.log all of the values in the programming object.

//This command will log all of 
//the keys to our browser console.


for (let key in programming) {
    console.log(key)
}



//This command will loop through all the objects and  
//log all the values of each object to the console.



for (let values in programming) {
    console.log(Object.values
    //object.values is used to access the values of programming keys
    (programming))
}



//This command tablet all the objects 
// to the browser console
    console.table(programming)
